## Other information
_Anything else you want to add._

_e.g. (NB: this example may be something we want to extract as it's probably common to a lot of services)_

### Logging

* The application uses [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus); the log file is initialised in [main.go](main.go).
* Logging requires an `env` app parameter, for all environments other than `local` logs are written to file.
* When running locally, logs are written to console. If you want to log locally to file, you need to pass in an env parameter that is != `local`.
* NOTE: `/__build-info` and `/__gtg` endpoints are not logged as they are called every second from varnish/vulcand and this information is not needed in logs/splunk.
